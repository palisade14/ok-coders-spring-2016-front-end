FizzBuzz:
- Write a program that prints (console.log()) all numbers from 1 to 100
- Modify the program to print "Fizz" if the number is divisible by 3
- Modify the program to print "Buzz" if the number is divisible by 5 (and not 3)
- Modify the program to print "FizzBuzz" if the number is divisible by 3 and 5






for(var i = 1; i < 101; i++) {
  // numbers divisible by 3 and 5 are divisible by 15
  if (i % 15 === 0) {
    console.log('FizzBuzz', i)
  } else if (i % 3 === 0) {
    console.log('Fizz', i)
  } else if (i % 5 === 0) {
    console.log('Buzz', i)
  } else {
    console.log(i)
  }
}
