Wiki with no css (Tim Berners-Lee page):
1. make the first paragraphs color (text color) red
2. Make the second paragraphs font-size larger
  - On the same paragraph set the width to half of the parent's width
  - Set the height to 80px
  - set overflow to scroll
3. Make the third paragraphs word-spacing wider
4. Make the 4th paragraphs background color grey
5. Make the width of the image in the career section 500px

FizzBuzz:
- Write a program that prints (console.log()) all numbers from 1 to 100
- Modify the program to print "Fizz" if the number is divisible by 3
- Modify the program to print "Buzz" if the number is divisible by 5 (and not 3)
- Modify the program to print "FizzBuzz" if the number is divisible by 3 and 5

for(var i = 1; i < 101; i++) {
  // numbers divisible by 3 and 5 are divisible by 15
  if (i % 15 === 0) {
    console.log('FizzBuzz', i)
  } else if (i % 3 === 0) {
    console.log('Fizz', i)
  } else if (i % 5 === 0) {
    console.log('Buzz', i)
  } else {
    console.log(i)
  }
}

2nd Class:
1. Create 4 divs (but make the 3rd div a child of the second div)
2. Make the first one 40px tall and make it stick to the top of the page.
  - Give it a grey background.
  - Add a list inside this with a home, contact, and about elements
3. Make the last div 30px tall
4. Make the second one's position relative (and make it 1500px tall)
5. Make the third one's position absolute (and make it 40px tall)
 - in chrome tools start futzing around with left, right, top, and bottom values
   (you can even use negative values)

1. create a function that returns the square of the requested number (the parameter)
2. make a for loop that goes from 1 to 100 and prints (console.log) each number
3. wrap the for loop in a function that takes a parameter for the up to part (i.e 1 to x)
4. extend the for loop to utilize the square function to calculate the sum of
squares for the up to x variable


so, you should have a function that takes a number (say 50), that will return to
you the sum of squares from 1 to 50

sumOfSquares(50)
....
42,925














function sumOfSquares(number) {
  var total = 0
  for (var i = 1; i <= number; i++) {
    total = total + square(i)
  }
  return total
}

function square(x) {
  return x * x
}

console.log(sumOfSquares(50))
