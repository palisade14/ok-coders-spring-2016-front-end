Tuesday:

Bash exercise:
- | can be used on the command line for "piping". Try to use | and the wc
  program to get a count of documents inside any directory on your computer.

Higher-Order Functions exercise:
- Reduce is a common higher order function. It takes an array and "reduces" it
  to one value based off of the function that is passed to it. Try to fill out
  the body of reduce to get that functionality

  var seedArray = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

  function reduce(array, callback) {
    ...
  }

  function seedCallback(total, current) {
    return total + current
  }

  console.log(reduce(seedArray, seedCallback))

Thursday:

There is another common higher order function called map (it is my favorite
one), it takes a collection and returns the same outer type. i.e if you send it
an array, it returns an array (the inside of the array can change). Try to make
the higher order function called map. Then call it so that it takes in an array
of numbers and returns an array with the same length, but with each number incremted by 15.
