Tuesday:

Bash exercise:
- | can be used on the command line for "piping". Try to use | and the wc
  program to get a count of documents inside any directory on your computer.

Higher-Order Functions exercise:
- Reduce is a common higher order function. It takes an array and "reduces" it
  to one value based off of the function that is passed to it. Try to fill out
  the body of reduce to get that functionality

  var seedArray = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

  function reduce(array, callback) {
    ...
  }

  function seedCallback(total, current) {
    return total + current
  }

  console.log(reduce(seedArray, seedCallback))
