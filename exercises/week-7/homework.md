# Pull in photos for the rovers

Here is the documentation from the Nasa api for the photos collected by their
rovers: https://api.nasa.gov/api.html#MarsPhotos

Using their documentation, make a resource that will pull in photos for
particular rovers. Actually include the photos in your site by using the
provided link that comes back (img src).

You can go really far with this. Try to do as little as possible to get a proof
of concept working and then extend your app. For example allow user input to
query particular attributes like camera and sol.
