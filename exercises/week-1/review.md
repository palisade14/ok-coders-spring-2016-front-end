##HTML
html is like a tree, and always should have a head and a body. From there you
utlize block level or inline elements. You can write comments in your code.
Sometimes elements wrap content, and sometimes they are self closing/contained
tags. All elements can have attributes, and if something is self contained it
most likely will have an attribute.
