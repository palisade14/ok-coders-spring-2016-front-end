    <h2>Tim Berners-Lee</h2>
    <h6>From Wiki, the free encyclopedia</h6>
    <p>
      Sir Timothy John Berners-Lee OM KBE FRS FREng FRSA FBCS (born 8 June 1955),[1]
      also known as TimBL, is an English computer scientist, best known as the
      inventor of the World Wide Web. He made a proposal for an information management
      system in March 1989,[3] and he implemented the first successful communication
      between a Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) client and server via the Internet
      sometime around mid-November of that same year.

    <h2>Early Life and Education</h2>
    <p>
      Berners-Lee was born in London, England,[20] one of four children born to Mary
      Lee Woods and Conway Berners-Lee. His parents worked on the first
      commercially-built computer, the Ferranti Mark 1. He attended Sheen Mount
      Primary School, and then went on to attend south west London's Emanuel School
      from 1969 to 1973, at the time a direct grant grammar school, which became an
      independent school in 1975.[1][14] A keen trainspotter as a child, he learnt
      about electronics from tinkering with a model railway.[21] He studied at The
      Queen's College, Oxford[1] from 1973 to 1976, where he received a first-class
      degree bachelor of arts degree in physics.[20]

      After graduation, Berners-Lee worked as an engineer at the telecommunications
      company Plessey in Poole, Dorset.[20] In 1978, he joined D. G. Nash in Ferndown,
      Dorset, where he helped create type-setting software for printers.[20]

      Berners-Lee worked as an independent contractor at CERN from June to December
      1980. While in Geneva, he proposed a project based on the concept of hypertext,
      to facilitate sharing and updating information among researchers.[22] To
      demonstrate it, he built a prototype system named ENQUIRE.[23]

      After leaving CERN in late 1980, he went to work at John Poole's Image Computer
      Systems, Ltd, in Bournemouth, Dorset.[24] He ran the company's technical side
      for three years.[25] The project he worked on was a "real-time remote procedure
      call" which gave him experience in computer networking.[24] In 1984, he returned
      to CERN as a fellow.[23]
