    <h2>Tim Berners-Lee</h2>
    <h6>From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia</h6>
    <p>
Sir Timothy John Berners-Lee OM KBE FRS FREng FRSA FBCS (born 8 June 1955),[1] also known as TimBL, is an English computer scientist, best known as the inventor of the World Wide Web. He made a proposal for an information management system in March 1989,[3] and he implemented the first successful communication between a Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) client and server via the Internet sometime around mid-November of that same year.[4][5][6][7][8]

Berners-Lee is the director of the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C), which
oversees the continued development of the Web. He is also the founder of the
World Wide Web Foundation, and is a senior researcher and holder of the founders
chair at the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MIT_Computer_Science_and_Artificial_Intelligence_Laboratory">MIT Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence
  Laboratory</a>
(CSAIL).[9] He is a director of the Web Science Research Initiative (WSRI),[10]
and a member of the advisory board of the MIT Center for Collective
Intelligence.[11][12] In 2011, he was named as a member the board of trustees of
the Ford Foundation.[13]

In 2004, Berners-Lee was knighted by Queen Elizabeth II for his pioneering work.[14][15] In April 2009, he was elected a foreign associate of the United States National Academy of Sciences.[16][17] He was honoured as the "Inventor of the World Wide Web" during the 2012 Summer Olympics opening ceremony, in which he appeared in person, working with a vintage NeXT Computer at the London Olympic Stadium.[18] He tweeted "This is for everyone",[19] which instantly was spelled out in LCD lights attached to the chairs of the 80,000 people in the audience.[18]

    <h3> Early life and education </h3>
    <p>
Berners-Lee was born in London, England,[20] one of four children born to Mary Lee Woods and Conway Berners-Lee. His parents worked on the first commercially-built computer, the Ferranti Mark 1. He attended Sheen Mount Primary School, and then went on to attend south west London's Emanuel School from 1969 to 1973, at the time a direct grant grammar school, which became an independent school in 1975.[1][14] A keen trainspotter as a child, he learnt about electronics from tinkering with a model railway.[21] He studied at The Queen's College, Oxford[1] from 1973 to 1976, where he received a first-class degree bachelor of arts degree in physics.[20]

    <h3>Career</h3>
    <p>
After graduation, Berners-Lee worked as an engineer at the telecommunications company Plessey in Poole, Dorset.[20] In 1978, he joined D. G. Nash in Ferndown, Dorset, where he helped create type-setting software for printers.[20]

Berners-Lee worked as an independent contractor at CERN from June to December 1980. While in Geneva, he proposed a project based on the concept of hypertext, to facilitate sharing and updating information among researchers.[22] To demonstrate it, he built a prototype system named ENQUIRE.[23]

After leaving CERN in late 1980, he went to work at John Poole's Image Computer Systems, Ltd, in Bournemouth, Dorset.[24] He ran the company's technical side for three years.[25] The project he worked on was a "real-time remote procedure call" which gave him experience in computer networking.[24] In 1984, he returned to CERN as a fellow.[23]

In 1989, CERN was the largest Internet node in Europe, and Berners-Lee saw an opportunity to join hypertext with the Internet:
